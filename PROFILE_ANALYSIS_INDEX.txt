KEY STATISTICS:
===============

Overall Completion: ~40%

Breakdown:
- Pages: 25% (1 of 4)
- Widgets: 57% (4 of 7)
- Providers: 50% (1 of 2)
- State Management: 100% (profile state complete)
- Routing: 70% (missing followers/following routes)
- Navigation: 30% (8 items unconnected)
- Tab Content: 0% (all placeholders)

Unimplemented Items: 8 TODOs in ProfilePage + 4 empty files

CRITICAL GAPS:
==============

1. Followers/Following Pages - EMPTY (0%)
2. Edit Profile Page - STUB (5%)
3. Tab Content - PLACEHOLDER (0%)
4. Navigation Integration - PARTIAL (30%)
5. Menu Actions - PARTIAL (30%)
6. Follow Loading State - HARDCODED (50%)

STRENGTHS:
==========

- Responsive design throughout (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Clean state management with Riverpod
- Well-organized component architecture
- Proper error/loading/empty states
- Good DI setup and dependency management
- Optimistic updates for follow/unfollow
- 4 polished, complete widgets

WEAKNESSES:
===========

- Too many placeholder implementations
- Multiple empty files that need implementation
- Navigation buttons not connected
- TODO comments indicating incomplete work
- Hardcoded loading states

QUICK START GUIDE:
==================

To understand the profile feature:

1. Start with PROFILE_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md
   - Quick overview of what exists
   - Visual structure of files
   - Status of each component

2. Read profile_architecture.txt
   - Understand how components fit together
   - See data flow diagrams
   - Learn state management flow

3. Check profile_todos.txt
   - See exact locations of unimplemented items
   - Code snippets showing what's missing
   - List of empty files needing implementation

4. Reference PROFILE_TESTING.md
   - Manual testing checklist
   - Setup instructions
   - Test scenarios

NEXT STEPS:
===========

Phase 1: Implement missing pages (15 hours)
- Followers page
- Following page
- Edit profile form
- Add missing routes

Phase 2: Connect navigation (8 hours)
- Wire up all button taps
- Connect menu actions
- Implement follow loading state

Phase 3: Tab content (8 hours)
- Implement PostsGrid widget
- Fetch and display posts/media/likes

Phase 4: Polish (3 hours)
- Delete unused widgets
- Add animations
- Error handling

Total Estimated Effort: ~34 hours (1 week)
